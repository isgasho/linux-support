{
	/// Executes a program.
	///
	/// It is recommended that Linux run with at least 2 cores assigned to the Kernel; one of these will be used as a master logical core, and the other will be used for control threads as necessary.
	/// Neither usage is particularly high or critical.
	///
	/// If running interactively `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are intercepted and will be re-raised (using libc's `raise()`) after handling so that any parent shell can behave correctly.
	///
	/// Always returns normally; panics are handled and returned as `ProcessConfigurationExecutionError::ExecutionPanicked`.
	///
	/// Notes:-
	///
	/// * The daemon `irqbalance` should not really be run when this program is running. It isn't incompatible per se, but it isn't useful.
	/// * It is recommended to boot the kernel with the command line parameter `irqaffinity` set to the inverse of `isolcpus`.
