		/// The reset-on-fork flag is intended for media-playback applications, and can be used to prevent applications evading the `RLIMIT_RTTIME` resource limit (see `getrlimit()`) by creating multiple child processes.
		///
		/// More precisely, if the reset-on-fork flag is set, the following rules apply for subsequently created children:-
		///
		/// *  If the calling thread has a scheduling policy of `RealTimeFirstInFirstOut` or `RealTimeRoundRobin`, the policy is reset to `Normal` in child processes.
		/// *  If the calling process has a negative nice value, the nice value is reset to zero in child processes.
		///
		/// After the reset-on-fork flag has been enabled, it can be reset only if the thread has the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability.
		/// This flag is disabled in child processes created by `fork()`.

		/// This flag allows a thread with a `SchedulerPolicy::Deadline` to reclaim bandwidth unused by other real-time threads (those with a `SchedulerPolicy` of either `RealTimeFirstInFirstOut`, `RealTimeRoundRobin` or `Deadline`).
