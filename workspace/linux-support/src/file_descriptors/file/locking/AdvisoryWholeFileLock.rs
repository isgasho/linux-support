/// Advisory whole-file lock types.
///
/// Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and then a new lock is established.
/// Between these two steps, a pending lock request by another process may be granted, with the result that the conversion either blocks, or fails if using a non-blocking variant.
///
/// These *MAY NOT WORK* on files on NFS shares and non-local file systems; Linux kernel support is inconsistent and difficult to deduce.
