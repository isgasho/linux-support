//! #file-descriptors
//!
//! file-descriptors is a Rust crate wrapping the various kinds of file descriptors with safe abstractions, including IPv4 / IPv6 sockets, Unix domain sockets, epoll, timerfd, signalfd, eventfd, POSIX message queues, pipes, FIFOs, terminals (and serial ports), character devices, inotify, fanotify and Files.
//!
//! There is a particularly extensive and safe wrapper for signals and terminals.
//!
//!
//! ## Supported File Descriptors
//!
//! * character devices.
//! * directories (with `*at()` atomic operations on files).
//! * epoll.
//! * eventfd.
//! * fanotify.
//! * inotify.
//! * POSIX message queues (<(https://linux.die.net/man/7/mq_overview>).
//! * pipes and FIFOs (anonymous and named FIFOs), including support for splice, vmsplice and tee.
//! * signalfd.
//! * sockets (TCP, UDP and the equivalent over Unix Domain Sockets; sendfile supported).
//! * terminals (serial ports and modems).
//! * timerfd.
//!
//! Additionally, extensions (`SendFile`, `SpliceRecipient` and `SpliceSender`) are implemented for Rust's `File`.
//!
//!
//! ## Unix Domain Sockets
//!
//!
//! ### When using file paths
//!
//! * Every effort is made to create the socket file path cleanly;
//! * To make sure all parent folders exist;
//! * To make sure parent folder permissions are correctly set;
//! * To remove any stale files;
//! * To remove socket file paths on drop (close).
//!
//! The above features may not work correctly after the use of `seccomp` to lock down system calls (particularly the attempt to delete a socket file path on close).
//!
//!
//! ## Pipes
//!
//! * The use of `splice()`, `vmsplice()` and `tee()` are supported for all file descriptors where possible (including Rust's `std::fs::File`).
//! * To be able to use epoll with standard in (`stdin`), use `pipes_and_fifos::ReceivePipeFileDescriptor::standard_in()`.
//! * To be able to use epoll with standard out (`stdout`), use `pipes_and_fifos::SendPipeFileDescriptor::standard_out()`.
//! * To be able to use epoll with standard error (`stderr`), use `pipes_and_fifos::SendPipeFileDescriptor::standard_error()`.
//!
//!
//! ## Unsupported for now
//!
//! * Linux zero copy send (`MSG_ZEROCOPY`) and receive (`SO_ZEROCOPY`), mostly because they have a horrible, hacky API.
//! * `SO_BUSY_POLL`.
//! * Unix Domain Sockets using `autobind`; setting of the `SO_PASSCRED` socket option.
//! * Receiving credentials over Unix Domain Sockets using `recvmsg()`.
//! * infiniband sockets.
//! * canbus (SocketCAN sockets and can4linux <http://can-wiki.info/can4linux/man/can4linux_8h_source.html> character device drivers).
