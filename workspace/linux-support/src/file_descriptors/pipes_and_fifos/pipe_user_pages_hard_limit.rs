/// Get the hard limit.

/// The hard limit is the total size (in pages) of all pipes created or set by a single unprivileged user (one without the `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities), after which an user can not create pipes.
///
/// Reads from `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard`.
///
/// `None` means no limit.
/// Default is no limit.
///
/// Since Linux 4.5.
/// Not buggy since Linux 4.9.
