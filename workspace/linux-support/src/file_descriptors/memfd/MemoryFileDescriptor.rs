/// A memfd; only works on files.
pub trait MemoryFileDescriptor: Sized + AsRawFd + AsRawFdExt + IntoRawFd + FromRawFd
{
	/// Opens a memfd.
	///
	/// There are two uses:-
	///
	/// * As an alternative to using `/tmp`, `tmpfs` or `O_TMPFILE` if there is no intention to link a file into the file system;
	/// * To use file sealing (see <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>); particularly `F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE` for a shared memory buffer.
	///
	/// The file can be mmap'd and the file descriptor passed to other processes like any other.
	///
	/// The initial size of the file is set to 0.
	///
	/// Following the call, the file size should be set using `ftruncate()`, or writes made using `write()` or the like.
	///
	/// `non_unique_name_for_debugging_purposes` can be seen under `/proc/self/fd` prefixed with `memfd:`.
	/// It does not have to be unique.
	///
	/// `allow_sealing_operations`:  If true, then the `fcntl()` `F_ADD_SEALS` and `F_GET_SEALS` operations are supported; the initial set of seals is empty.
	/// If not specifed, then the initial set of seals will be `F_SEAL_SEAL`, meaning that no other seals can be set on the file.
	///
	/// `huge_page_size` supports the following:-
	///
	/// * `None`: No huge pages.
	/// * `Some(None)`: Use the system default huge page size.
	/// * `Some(Some(huge_page_size))`: Use the specific `huge_page_size` huge page size.
	///
	/// The resultant file descriptor will have the close-on-exec flag set (as do all file descriptors created in the super module, `file_descriptors`).
	///
	/// Supported since Linux 3.17.
	/// However, support for `allow_sealing_operations` with `huge_page_size` has only existed since Linux 4.16.
