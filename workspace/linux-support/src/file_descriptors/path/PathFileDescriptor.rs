/*
The following operations can be performed on the resulting
              file descriptor:

              *  close(2).

              *  fchdir(2), if the file descriptor refers to a directory
                 (since Linux 3.5).

              *  fstat(2) (since Linux 3.6).

              *  fstatfs(2) (since Linux 3.12).

              *  Duplicating the file descriptor (dup(2), fcntl(2) F_DUPFD,
                 etc.).

              *  Getting and setting file descriptor flags (fcntl(2) F_GETFD
                 and F_SETFD).

              *  Retrieving open file status flags using the fcntl(2)
                 F_GETFL operation: the returned flags will include the bit
                 O_PATH.

              *  Passing the file descriptor as the dirfd argument of
                 openat() and the other "*at()" system calls.  This includes
                 linkat(2) with AT_EMPTY_PATH (or via procfs using
                 AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW) even if the file is not a directory.

              *  Passing the file descriptor to another process via a UNIX
                 domain socket (see SCM_RIGHTS in unix(7)).

              When O_PATH is specified in flags, flag bits other than
              O_CLOEXEC, O_DIRECTORY, and O_NOFOLLOW are ignored.
