       BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM
              Look up an element by key in a specified map and return its
              value.

       BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM
              Create or update an element (key/value pair) in a specified
              map.

       BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM
              Look up and delete an element by key in a specified map.

       BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY
              Look up an element by key in a specified map and return the
              key of the next element.
