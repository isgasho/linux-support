/// CPU feature checks which can be suppressed.
///
/// Current names (and typical warning messages) are:-
///
/// * `spectre_v2_google`: "Kernel has `spectre_v2=retpoline,google`; this is probably not the best choice".
/// * `has_rep_movsb_stosb`: "Your CPU does not support the REP MOVSB and REP STOSB instructions, which are optimal for some memory moves and copies".
/// * `has_prefetchw`: "Your CPU does not support the PRETFCHW instruction, which is optimal for some memory moves and copies".
/// * `has_ss`: "Your CPU does not support self-snoop of the cache (which nearly all should), which is important for efficient cache management in this application".
/// * `has_working_xsave`: "CPU architecture either lacks XSAVE support or the Linux kernel has disabled XSAVE support".
/// * `has_invpcid`: "Your CPU does not support the INVPCID instruction, which is important for efficient mitigation of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities".
/// * `has_smap`: "Your CPU does not support the Supervisor-Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) instructions CLAC and STAC, which are important for securing modern Linux systems".
