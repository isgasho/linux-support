	/// * `has_prefetchw`: "Your CPU does not support the PRETFCHW instruction, which is optimal for some memory moves and copies".
	/// * `has_ss`: "Your CPU does not support self-snoop of the cache (which nearly all should), which is important for efficient cache management in this application".
	/// * `has_working_xsave`: "CPU architecture either lacks XSAVE support or the Linux kernel has disabled XSAVE support".
	/// * `has_invpcid`: "Your CPU does not support the INVPCID instruction, which is important for efficient mitigation of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities".
	/// * `has_smap`: "Your CPU does not support the Supervisor-Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) instructions CLAC and STAC, which are important for securing modern Linux systems".

	///
	/// Current names (and typical warning messages) are:-

	/// * `noaliencache`: "Kernel has `noaliencache` enabled; this is likely to hurt performance".
	/// * `numa_zonelist_order`: "Kernel has `noaliencache` enabled; this is likely to hurt performance".
	/// * `skew_tick`: "Kernel should have `skew_tick=1` for maximum performance at the cost of power consumption".

	/// * `too_few_shared_hyper_threads`: "There is only 1 shared hyper thread (which will be shared with the master logical core and control threads)".
	/// * `overlapping_shared_hyper_threads`: "More than one (actually, {}) hyper threads of the group '{:?}' are present in the shared hyper threads".
