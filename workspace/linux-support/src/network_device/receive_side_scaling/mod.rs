indirection table is called RETA
To use Toeplitz or XOR or CRC32, the feature NETIF_F_RXHASH should be set.

`rxfhindir_key`
size is dictated by ethtool_rxfh.cmd=ETHTOOL_GRSSH, ethtool_rxfh.key_size
	hash keys are not supported if ethtool_rxfh.key_size is 0.

contexts
	- can create using context new
	- can manipulate using context CTX
	- can delete using delete CTX
	- CTX is a u32; default is 0
	- a new context is created using ETH_RXFH_CONTEXT_ALLOC
	- #define ETH_RXFH_CONTEXT_ALLOC		0xffffffff
	- CTX 0 id the default context for normal traffic.
