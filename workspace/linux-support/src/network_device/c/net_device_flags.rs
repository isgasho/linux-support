bitflags!
{
	/// Network device flags.
	///
	/// These can be set by drivers, the kernel and some can be triggered by userspace.
	/// Userspace can query and set these flags using userspace utilities but there is also a sysfs entry available for all dev flags which can be queried and set.
	/// These flags are shared for all types of net_devices.
	/// The sysfs entries are available via `/sys/class/net/<dev>/flags`.
	/// Flags which can be toggled through sysfs are annotated below, note that only a few flags can be toggled and some other flags are always preserved from the original flags even if you try to set them via sysfs.
	/// Flags which are always preserved are kept under the flag grouping `IFF_VOLATILE`.
	/// Flags which are volatile are annotated below as such.
	///
	/// Notes:-
	/// * The flags `IFF_LOOPBACK`, `IFF_BROADCAST` and `IFF_POINTOPOINT` can not be changed by userspace as they describe link media characteristics.
	/// * If a link does not have any of the flags `IFF_LOOPBACK`, `IFF_BROADCAST` and `IFF_POINTOPOINT` set then it is a non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) network device.
	/// * If a link has any of the  flags `IFF_LOOPBACK`, `IFF_BROADCAST` and `IFF_POINTOPOINT` set then it supports multicasts even if `IFF_MULTICAST` is not set.
	/// * Combination `IFF_BROADCAST | IFF_POINTOPOINT` is invalid.
