/// How rings are laid out when accessing virtual functions or offloaded queues is device specific.
///
/// To allow users to do flow steering and specify these queues the ring cookie is partitioned into a 32bit queue index with an 8 bit virtual function id.
/// This also leaves the 3 bytes for further specifiers; it is possible future devices may support more than 256 virtual functions (eg if using PCIe with ARI).
