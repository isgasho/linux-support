	/// Turns off interrupt moderation.

	/// May improve small packet latency.
	/// However, this is generally not suitable for bulk throughput traffic due to the increased CPU utilization of the higher interrupt rate.
	///
	/// Setting this for 82599, X540 and X550 adapters causes "HW RSC" to be disabled.
	Off,

	/// This attempts to moderate interrupts per vector while maintaining very low latency.
	/// This can sometimes cause extra CPU utilization.
	/// Intel says: "If planning on deploying ixgbevf in a latency sensitive environment, this parameter should be considered".
	Dynamic,

	/// This will program the adapter to send at most that many interrupts per second, even if more packets have come in.
	///
	/// This reduces interrupt load on the system and can lower CPU utilization under heavy load, but will increase latency as packets are not processed as quickly.
