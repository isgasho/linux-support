	/// RFC 2308, Section 5: "A negative answer that resulted from a name error (NXDOMAIN) should be cached such that it can be retrieved and returned in response to another query for the same <QNAME, QCLASS> that resulted in the cached negative response.

	/// For us, this means caching a negative response against the `QNAME` unary tuple for the last resolved name in the `CNAME` chain.
