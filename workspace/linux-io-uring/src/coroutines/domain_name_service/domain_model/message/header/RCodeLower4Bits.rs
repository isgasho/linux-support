/// With `EDNS(0)` (see RFC 6891) and the not-quite unified error code space clarified in RFC 6895, Section 2.1 RCODE Assignment, error codes have become a complicated mess with overlapping assignments.
///
/// It is also no longer possible to short-circuit processing of a message until after most or all of the Additional Section has been processed, in case an `EDNS(0)` `OPT` record is present (or not present when it should be present).
/// This, of course, makes any potential Denial-of-Service attack more effective as it forces nearly complete processing of each reply, rather than fail-fast after parsing the message header.
