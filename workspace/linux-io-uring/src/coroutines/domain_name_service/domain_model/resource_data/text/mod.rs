	TODO: TXT - needs sorting, are there standard key formats?
	    * DNS-SD
	        * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763#section-6>
	        * Section 6.7.  Version Tag, defines a version key that *should* occur first in a record.
	            * txtvers
	            * protovers
	        * Multiple strings are multiple key-values or just boolean present keys.
	        * Uses _service._tcp.example.com for the owner name
	        * Multiple TXT records are possible but discouraged
	        * There is a registry.
	        * See <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml>
	    * DMARC
	        * Starts "v=DMARC1;"
	        * only for owner names that start "_dmarc.example.com"
	    * SPF
	        * RFC 7298, Section 3.3 Multiple Strings in a Single DNS Record.
	        * Solitary
	        * first string must start "v=spf1 "
	    * DKIM
	        * RFC 6376, <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#page-53> Section 7.5 for a list of valid tags.
	        * Only for owner names containing `_domainkey` eg "selector._domainkey.example.net" or "_domainkey.example.net"
	            * Can selectors have dots?
	        * Starts "v=DKIM1;"
	    * Site verification, eg
	        "google-site-verification=6P08Ow5E-8Q0m6vQ7FMAqAYIDprkVV8fUf_7hZ4Qvc8"
	        "facebook-domain-verification=somethingbase64"
	        Would seem to be key-value
	    * Amazon SES
	        * Has an owner name of `_amazonses`
	    * RFC 1464 defines a structure format, heavily abused, but essentially key=value in which keys are supposed to printable ASCII and case-insensitive; any '=' sign in an attribute name is supposed to be escaped with a preceeding backquote (`); backquotes are escaped likewise as ``. Empty attribute names are not permitted.
	    * See examples at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record
