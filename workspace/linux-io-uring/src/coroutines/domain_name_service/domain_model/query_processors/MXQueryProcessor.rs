		/*
		n the absence of a protocol whose specification calls for the
				use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV
				RRs of the same Priority in the order in which target hosts,
				specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted. The following
				algorithm SHOULD be used to order the SRV RRs of the same
				priority:
		
		To select a target to be contacted next, arrange all SRV RRs
				(that have not been ordered yet) in any order, except that all
				those with weight 0 are placed at the beginning of the list.
		
				Compute the sum of the weights of those RRs, and with each RR
				associate the running sum in the selected order.
				
				Then choose a
				uniform random number between 0 and the sum computed
				(inclusive), and select the RR whose running sum value is the
				first in the selected order which is greater than or equal to
				the random number selected.
				
				The target host specified in the
				selected SRV RR is the next one to be contacted by the client.
				
				Remove this SRV RR from the set of the unordered SRV RRs and
				apply the described algorithm to the unordered SRV RRs to select
				the next target host.
				
				Continue the ordering process until there
				are no unordered SRV RRs.
				
				This process is repeated for each
				Priority.
