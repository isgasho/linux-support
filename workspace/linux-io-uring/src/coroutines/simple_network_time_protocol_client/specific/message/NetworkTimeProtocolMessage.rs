	/// This is a 32-bit unsigned fixed-point number indicating the maximum error due to the clock frequency tolerance, in seconds with the fraction point between bits 15 and 16.

	///
	/// Zero for client messages.
	/// This field is significant only in server messages, where for stratum 0 (kiss-o'-death message) and 1 (primary server), the value is a four-character ASCII string, left justified and zero padded to 32 bits.
	/// For IPv4 secondary servers, the value is the 32-bit IPv4 address of the synchronization source.

	/// If the server has not yet been synchronized itself, then it is zero.

	/// This is the time at which the request departed the client for the server, in 64-bit timestamp format.

	/// Layout is known as 'Timestamp Format'.

	/// ie when a client receives a server message, this is the sent client message's `transmit_timestamp`.

	///
	/// Layout is known as 'Timestamp Format'.

	/// This is the time at which the request departed the client or the reply departed the server, in 64-bit timestamp format.
	///
	/// Layout is known as 'Timestamp Format'.
	///
	/// Although setting the Transmit Timestamp field in the request to the time of day according to the client clock in NTP timestamp format is not necessary in a conforming client implementation, it is highly recommended.
	/// This allows a simple calculation to determine the propagation delay between the server and client and to align the system clock generally within a few tens of milliseconds relative to the server.
	/// In addition, this provides a simple method for verifying that the server reply is in fact a legitimate response to the specific client request and thereby for avoiding replays.
