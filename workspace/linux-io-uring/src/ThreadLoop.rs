	user_data =>
		- last operation performed so we can interpret cqe.res
			- and file descriptor type so we can 'rehydrate' eg a particular SocketEnum
				- eg 2 types of file (memory, regular file)
			- this type code needs to combine file-descriptor-type + IORING_OP
				- not all ops for all file descriptor types
		- file descriptor or file descriptor index
			- non-atomic count of file descriptor so we know when to close.
		- coroutine to invoke to continue operation
			- not all operations are per-coroutine; some are per thread
				- eg if trying to invoke a new coroutine for a new socket file descriptor, we're out of coroutine memory; we'll need to close(new_socket_fd) using io-uring
		- any data structures, such as buffers, open_how, &mut statx, etc that can now be freed (recycled)
			- these should reside in an Arena of the particular type.
	closing a file descriptor
		- count reaches 0
			- add a close() event, but still retain entry as close() can fail
			- if using reg'd file descriptors, chain-link close SQE to a file update SQE

	Do we need to reference count file descriptors
		- No - Use dup2() et al so different coroutines and threads don't need to open the same file path

	Challenges
		- There is no ordering to completions unless 'linked'
		- We can avoid having ANY file descriptor typing information by relying solely on the coroutine to 'know'
			- If we want to enable coroutines that can start multiple operations in parallel, we need to provide a way so they know which of their operations has completed
			- we could do this by using, say, 4 bits of the user_data to give 16 parallel operations per coroutine.

Performance suggestions:

Until Linux 5.6 at least



Batch syscalls

Use io_uring_for_each_cqe to peek multiple cqes once, handle them and enqueue multiple sqes. After all cqes are handled, submit all sqes.

Handle multiple (cqes), submit (sqes) once
For non-disk I/O, always POLL before READ/RECV

For operations that may block, kernel will punt them into a kernel worker called io-wq, which turns out to have high overhead cost. Always make sure that the fd to read is ready to read.

This will change in Linux 5.7



Don't use IOSQE_IO_LINK

As for Linux 5.6, IOSQE_IO_LINK has an issue that force operations after poll be executed async, that makes POLL_ADD mostly useless.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/5f09d89a-0c6d-47c2-465c-993af0c7ae71@kernel.dk/

Note: For READ-WRITE chain, be sure to check -ECANCELED result of WRITE operation ( a short read is considered an error in a link chain which will cancel operations after the operation ). Never use IOSQE_IO_LINK for RECV-SEND chain because you can't control the number of bytes to send (a short read for RECV is NOT considered an error. I don't know why).

This will change in Linux 5.7


Don't use FIXED_FILE & FIXED_BUFFER

They have little performace boost but increase much code complexity. Because the number of files and buffers can be registered has limitation, you almost always have to write fallbacks. In addition, you have to reuse the old file slots and buffers. See example: https://github.com/CarterLi/liburing4cpp/blob/daf6261419f39aae9a6624f0a271242b1e228744/demo/echo_server.cpp#L37

Note RECV/SEND have no _fixed variant.
