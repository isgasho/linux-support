/// Uses a tagged pointer scheme:-
///
/// * On 64-bit systems, pointers are always 64-bit (8 byte) aligned, so the lowest three bits are always zero.
/// * On x86-64 and AArch64, pointers are 48-bit, so the top 16 bits are available, and, for user space, are always zero.
/// * On x86-64, pointers are technically 47-bit, with the 48th bit (one-based counting) always fixed as zero.
/// * If using pointers to structs which are a power-of-two size, pointers may have a greater alignment so giving more lower bits:-
/// 	* 16-byte aligned data has 4 lowest bits available.
/// 	* 32-byte aligned data has 5 lowest bits available.
/// 	* 64-byte aligned data has 6 lowest bits available.
/// * In the future, Intel will support 52-bit points and Arm 56-bit pointers, but these will be opt-in.
/// * Further bits are available if a pointer is relative to some base.
///
/// However, if we are integrating with `CoroutineInstanceHandle`, the topmost bit can never be set.
